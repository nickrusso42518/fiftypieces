# Epilogue
Many close friends encouraged me *not* to write this book. "Stick with what you know", they said. "This isn't your market and it wonâ€™t sell", others claimed.  To a person, they meant well, but I couldn't agree. I'm not in the data communications business, or the software development business, or the technical training business. I see myself and everyone else as living and thinking humans with the capacity for growth outside of our day jobs. You've now heard a year's worth of my unfiltered thoughts, ideas, experiments, and blunders. Surely you've disagreed with parts of it, but hopefully you've found value in all.
