# Prologue
No one likes boring book introductions, and some of you might be tempted to
skip through this part. Those of you who have consumed my existing
publications know that I am not one for small talk. I'm writing this book
because I want to introduce people to a new way of thinking. I want to share
my own personal experiences, including successes, failures, and everything in
between. I'm writing this book because I want to change the way advice is
shared.

For all of 2019, I wrote approximately one blog per week for a total
of 50. I discuss a wide variety of topics ranging from technology to business
to human relationships. This work is complementary to my other highly
technical content as there is nothing technically challenging in this book. 

The book is sorted into six sections by topic rather than by chronology to
help focus your train of thought. I'll also provide a bit of context at the
start of each section. I have only one request. As you listen, keep an open
mind, because 100% of you are undoubtedly going to hear things with which you
disagree at some point. I often try to meaningfully compare seemingly
incomparable topics in a single thought, something few others attempt. My
objective is to surface new ideas and novel ways of approaching problems, and
I truly hope you enjoy it.
