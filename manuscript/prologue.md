# Prologue
No one likes boring book introductions, and some of you might be tempted to skip through this part. Those of you who have consumed my existing publications know that I am not one for small talk. I'm writing this book because I want to introduce people to a new way of thinking. I want to share my own personal experiences, including successes, failures, and everything in between. I'm writing this book because I want to change the way advice is shared. I am dismayed that modern blogs have become springboards for advertisers, and seemingly, little else. This book, I hope, will serve as a refreshing change.

For all of 2019, I wrote approximately one blog per week for a total of 50. I discuss a wide variety of topics ranging from technology to business to human relationships. This work is complementary to my other highly technical content as there is nothing technically challenging in this book.

The book is sorted into six sections by topic rather than by chronology to help focus your train of thought. I'll also provide a bit of context at the start of each section. I have only one request. As you listen, keep an open mind, because 100% of you are undoubtedly going to hear things with which you disagree at some point. This book is going to be very different from others you have read. I often try to meaningfully compare seemingly incomparable topics in a single thought, something few others attempt. My objective is to surface new ideas and novel ways of approaching problems, and I truly hope you enjoy it.
