# Business Management
I started a small IT consulting and training business in 2018 and the non-stop learning that has resulted has been an emotional roller coaster. Some of these blogs relate to my own past experiences, while others take a future view about potential future paths and sources of growth.

## 1 Dec - Hypothesis

## 5 Apr - Single Point of Failure
This blog might seem like clickbait for the technically-minded who expected a sermon on how to build highly-available data communications networks. Not so. I'd like to share my thoughts on risk management instead, and for the techies, I'm sure you'll see some obvious parallels.

I want to frame the discussion around three types of risk. Think about it from a business perspective. For this example, I'll assume that in actuality, you are someone else's full-time employee. What customers do you have? Probably just one; your employer. How much of your annual revenue comes from that customer? Probably all of it. What is the impact of a competitor winning this business away from you? Staggering, as you'd be on the street. I'll call this **concentration risk**. What's better, one revenue stream of $100,000 per year, or five revenue streams of $20,000 per year?

In case it wasn't clear, I'm claiming that full-time employment by itself is a single point of failure and is risky, even if the job is "stable" (whatever that means). Let's assume you decide to author some books on the side. What's better, 10 books from one publisher or 2 books per 5 different publishers? I'd again argue the latter is the smarter choice. Suppose you choose the first option, as many authors do. Though you've augmented your full-time salary with some passive royalty income, you have exposed yourself to **platform risk**. Suppose your primary publisher folds. Suppose the content is video-on-demand and the publisher has a long-term web outage. Suppose the publisher has a public relations disaster unrelated to you and their brand sinks. Where are your residuals now?

Ever wonder why I produce small volumes of content across a large variety of media channels? For example: recorded training, live training, regular text books, and soon to be audio books. All of these delivery methods are negotiated with different companies with different payment terms. I can't always get paid quickly, but many great deals won't pay up cash front. I reduce my **credit risk** by properly managing my cash flow. The last thing I want is most of my revenue stuck in accounts receivable with a dying, insolvent customer. This is all part of a strategy to address the market from a variety of avenues and business relationships. If you are a niche specialist, you don't necessarily have to diversify your skills, but expand your sales scope and your brand widely.

Like Rich Dad teaches us, a full-time job with a big company is risky. This blog summarizes the three risks I work hard to avoid. Naturally my top risks will change as the business landscape changes. Yours should too.

## 16 Feb - Good, Cheap, Fast; Pick 3
The age-old adage says that you can only choose two attributes from the list of "good, cheap, or fast". I've seen all kinds of fancy mathematical graphs depicting a three-dimensional parabola that shows the limits of how the inputs of quality, cost, and lead time all interact. The CAP theorem for databases similarly suggests you can choose consistency, availability, or partition tolerance, but never all three. You can choose two, we are told, and trade-off the third. Intuitively, this makes sense, but is it a general truth? Let's examine all three possibilies.

  - A high-quality, low-cost product cannot be delivered quickly.
  - A high-quality product delivered quickly will be expensive.
  - Anything delivered rapidly at low cost will be low quality.

In many cases, the "choose two" constraint does hold true, and I even claimed so in a video series on network complexity I delivered to The Network Collective in 2018. Again, is this a universal truth? Only a single counterexample makes the generalization false.

In reality, the need to trade-off one attribute is **only** relevant when the system is performing respectably in the first place. Have you ever been woefully out of shape and decided to try a new diet and exercise plan? Assuming you actually tried, you likely experienced fat loss **and** muscle gain concurrently, while also not really spending much time in the gym. When the system (your body, in this case) is operating so poorly, it is possible to roundly improve all metrics at once for a short time. After the initial stage in your weight loss regimen, you'll hit a plateau, and your fat loss will come with muscle loss. For bulkers, your muscle gain will come with fat gain. Oh, and you'll also have to work measurably harder to see future improvements. Enter the trade-offs.

Now for a true story from my professional life. I helped a large US Federal Government customer migrate a delivery process from 100% manual operation to one that used a high degree of automation. The original process was slow, laborious (expensive), and often resulted in products needing rework. Our team was demonstrably able to reduce errors by an order of magnitude, reduce lead time from days to minutes, and significantly reduce human labor cost (long term operating expense). Additionally, no capital investment was required given the software components we used. Good, cheap, and fast, all at once, right? It's possible, I've done it, and don't let naysayers tell you it cannot be done.

## 7 Sep - Meeting Capital
One of my colleagues recently had a public explosion about his disdain for unnecessary, last-minute meetings. I've been thinking about this regularly and I want to suggest a solution which combines suggestions from several different business authors. First, I need to provide some context about their background.

In Patrick Lencioni's 2004 book "Death By Meeting", he suggests that attending meetings is the most important work executives do. I agree. Poorly run meetings waste time, money, effort, and are completely enervating. Lencioni describes the following plan:

  - Daily stand up: 5 minutes, exchange information
  - Weekly tactical: 60 minutes, short term tasks
  - Monthly strategic: 2 hours, big decision making
  - Quarterly offsite: 2 days, company/market introspection

Jocko Willinck and Leif Babin discuss the concept of "leadership capital" in their 2018 book "The Dichotomy of Leadership". They assert that leaders have a fixed amount of authority and influence. It can be invested wisely by enforcing important work standards and encouraging difficult but necessary changes. It can also be squandered on expense report penny-pinching or political loyalty to failing projects. John Maxwell describes a similar approach using "spare change" in "The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership", originally published in 1998, again using monetary terms to measure a leader's capability.

I'm proposing the introduction of "meeting capital". All will agree that "sharing information" is among the worst reasons to hold a meeting. Therefore, it is expensive in terms of meeting capital. Lencioni might call these "incidental clarity" meetings and they should be minimized. Recurring weekly tactical and monthly strategic meetings would cost less but still be deducted from the budget. Critical company-changing meetings where key decisions are made should be the least expensive and thus the most desirable to hold.

I've seen others try this approach except they've foolishly used time as the currency. For example, limiting total meeting time to 15 hours per week. The length of a meeting has no bearing on its value to the organization, just like hourly consulting rates do not align with measurable value creation.

## 9 Feb - Mind Your Own Business
Robert Kiyosaki's 1997 book "Rich Dad Poor Dad" suggests that we all "mind our own business". He's clear in stating that your "business" isn't your place of employment, but rather what **you** do to make money. Are you an author, podcaster, weekend lawnmower, investor, or something else? Figure out what topics interest you, and start thinking about how you can deliver unique value in those spaces. Note that non-profit or charity work qualifies as a "business" too, so long as you aren't someone else's employee while you do it.

John Sonmez gives similar advice, albeit less controversially. In his 2014 book "Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual", Sonmez encourages readers to start a blog, explore investing in financial instruments like stocks and bonds, consider real estate investing, investigate online training opportunities, writing books, and more. Real estate notwithstanding, none of these actions require large capital investments. Even as a highly technical consultant, Sonmez had the foresight to play the long game from a young age.

Last, consider the wisdom of Alan Weiss from his 2016 book "Million Dollar Consulting", 5th edition. He claims that consultants are not in the consulting business, but rather, the marketing business. Anyone who fails to sufficiently market themselves, especially when delivering on existing client obligations, is "stupid" in his words. Don't just blindly parrot motivational quotations you like. Don't differentiate by being different, but rather, by building your "vault" of products or services that **only you** can offer. If you don't have unique skills yet, offer commodity services while you plot your next move. Weiss offered resume assessments for $20 in his early days ... now look at him.

Whether you like the work of Kiyosaki, Sonmez, and Weiss is irrelevant. I happen to like all three and appreciate their unique perspectives, even if I don't agree with everything they have to say. Their points about taking control of your own future and positioning your unique value to prospects are excellent and should be universally acknowledged, accepted, and implemented. Neither Kiyosaki, nor Sonmez, nor Weiss recommend quitting your day job **right now** because you have a good idea. Start building your "business" with something relevant to your industry. Make sure it's both attainable and sustainable for you and your family.

## 15 Jun - Monopolies Are Bad
I've recently started reading some of Peter Drucker's work. The man is brilliant and is rightfully hailed as a thought leader in business management. The 2009 book "The Essential Drucker" concisely summarizes his many decades of work. Early in the book, he speaks of monopolies and their impacts on business. He isn't saying monopolies are bad for consumers, which is obviously true and well-known. He claims it is bad for the monopolizer, too.

Drucker first emphasizes the importance of considering **both sales and market share** together, rather than focusing only on one. If revenue is increasing but market share is not, the overall market is growing faster than you are, which is certainly bad. That means less influence over the direction of the market and weaker market penetration. If your market share is growing but sales are declining, competitors are exiting from what is probably a shrinking industry. You likely don't want to stick around for long.

The real question is, are these conditions both decidedly negative outcomes? I'll paraphrase Drucker's example using some numbers. Suppose you monopolize 100% of a product market that brings in $100 of revenue annually. You are the "old guard" with nothing but cash cow products and no capacity to innovate. The market has been stagnant for years ... why change it? Along comes a competitor with a superior product and, within a few months, takes half the market. Bad news for you, right?

Maybe not. If the new product is so much better **and** there is a market demand beyond the original market size, the market will grow. Suppose the market triples in size and you retain half of the market. You'll likely begin some product development efforts to remain competitive now as the market continues to expand. With a market now worth $300 total at a 50% share, you have $150. That's $50 more in your company coffers than when you monopolized the market. This is the essence of Drucker's argument. The growth of the market means better business profitability for both companies. Even with half the market share, you can still drive the direction of the market through open competition.

Although I don't work in the smart phone industry, I've long believed that the duopoly between iPhone and Android fits into this model. Had there been only one product choice, the new innovations with each successive model over the past decade may not have happened at all. I believe that competition has caused the market to grow exponentially and all market players have been richly rewarded. True, today's smart phone market is sluggish due to saturation in specific geographic regions, but would the introduction of another competitor cause the market to grow again?

## 16 Nov - Sufficiency

## 17 Aug - One Year in Business
**Loop Free Consulting**, my first company, has been in business roughly one year. It's been an incredible ride and deeply satisfying as the business is both profitable and growing faster than I can keep up. It's a good problem to have, but it was not without its challenges.

For some completely ridiculous reason, I thought it necessary to become a classic business administrator. I convinced myself that I needed a balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. I needed a website, logo, business cards, and maybe even a company vehicle. I'm grateful that a friend and fellow business owner provided some extraordinary wisdom: "Focus on your business, not the administration. Keep it simple." He went on to explain his intuitive techniques for accounting, wages, taxes, and more. I am eternally grateful for all the effort (that is, cost) that he prevented.

On the topic of business organization, I formed a sole proprietorship using a "doing business as" or "trade name". It was easy and cheap to setup. It gives me the flexibility to move money freely between personal and business accounts. I can always reorganize if there is a demand for it, but I saw little reason to introduce complexity from the beginning. Again, more great advice from my friend with years running a company.

When trying to grow sales, I dangerously underestimated the difficulty of closing deals with certain prospects. One current-day customer delivers a very high-quality product. This carried a steep audio/video production learning curve. They also required a high-stakes audition. I figured they would just hire me because I'm so great. I was stupid enough to start building content for them **before they even replied to me**. I should have known better. The toll of hubris weighed heavily on me as I scrapped weeks of work.

I also took third-hand advice about compensation regarding opportunities with another customer. I was told I could make serious money just by doing a "quick bootcamp", so I eagerly submitted multiple proposals for one-day courses on hot topics. All were accepted and I delivered sold-out, top-rated training. The money received was about one fourth what I forecasted. Due to my ignorance alone, I was not aware that these "quick bootcamps" were actually four days long! I don't regret it, but I realized that there are no shortcuts in business.

Now that I'm a bit older and wiser, I am learning that becoming a prudent business person isn't about spreadsheets, titles, or tax breaks. Never assume you are bigger than you are and stay focused on delivering value.
