# Money and Investing
Money is a fascinating topic, not least since all of humanity places our collective confidence in its value. I don't care much for century-old cost accounting techniques and prefer to talk about money in informal but practical terms. Often this includes criticism of existing institutions or know-how.

## 27 Jan - Time Value of Money
"That makes no sense", I told a business manager. "Why would we pay $100 per month for that service when we could buy a compute platform to run it for $3000? It pays for itself in two and a half years." I was convinced that these office-dwellers had no idea how to multiply.

Years ago, I was a simpleton on the topic of business investing. It was not obvious to me why cloud services were such a useful offering when, in many cases, the recurring cost of cloud exceeded the up-front investment of building things in-house, even across just a few years. It is true that I also failed to properly account for the hidden operating costs of running your own server, such as electricity, cooling, and basic lifecycle management. This blog isn't a discussion on those costs, but rather, the time value of money.

The concept suggests that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. The common rationalization supporting this assertion relies on currency inflation and the option to invest today's cash to earn interest. Both are obviously true, but I want to focus on two more: risk and uncertainty.

Imagine living in a world where inflation and investing didn't exist. Would you still want cash now versus cash later? I would. If you are owed money in the future, there is a risk that your debtor fails to repay (US mortgage crisis circa 2008). Or perhaps you run a business and have approved a large cash investment to purchase new machinery. Your staff suggests you'll see a positive cash flow from operations via increased sales in 2 years. They say you'll **really** see sales growth in 5 years. The accuracy of a sales forecast decreases rapidly the further into the future it attempts to predict ... quite uncertain in my view. How does one quantify risk and uncertainty?

If you have a good staff, they've attempted to **discount** the value of those future cash flows. No, I don't mean discounts like "half price" or "BOGO". In this context, the discount rate tries to account for risk and uncertainty by reducing the value of future money, both inflows and outflows. Coming up with a discount rate is tricky and outside the scope of this post, but higher rates imply greater risk. Those investing in Venezuela today should use a high discount rate, say 20%. Investing in the US or Germany, maybe 5%. As for my $3000 server example, would it really "pay for itself" in a couple years?

## 23 Feb - Net Income vs. Cash Flow
If you are a professional accountant, investor, or business owner, you can stop right here. This blog is for the financially-challenged technocrats among us. It wasn't until early 2017 that I realized how ignorant I was on these topics, so I picked up a $10 Udemy course by Chris Haroun titled "An Entire MBA in One Course". It's a great place to start and one of the best $10 purchases I've ever made.

While the bottom line, or net income, of a company's income statement generates media buzz unlike any other financial measurement, it doesn't tell the whole story. Sometimes companies go bankrupt even with positive net income. Why? There is an accounting system known as accrual-based accounting. This system counts revenue and expenses as they occur whether or not you are actually paid. At the time of this writing, I perform live training for O'Reilly (Safari). When I sign deals with them, I am immediately owed a grant payment to cover the cost of course development. Under the accrual accounting system, I would mark the income **now** despite not receiving the check for 10 days. O'Reilly would mark the expenses **now** despite not sending the check for 10 days. I didn't get richer and O'Reilly didn't get poorer; no cash has changed hands.

Ignoring the accounting books, this 10 day disconnect between income and cash inflow highlights the purpose of this post. As a business owner, regardless of your internal accounting system, you **must pay** attention to your cash flow. This is important because you cannot and should not measure your success by your net income alone. High net income and poor cash flow can make a company look artificially profitable.

At the time of this writing, about 40% of my net income is money I've earned through delivery but I haven't been paid yet. My bottom line looks great; my cash flow is abysmal. This is the result of unfavorable payment terms from some contracts I signed early on, before I really understood the impact. I was totally cool with delivering my services only to be paid for it several months later.

When I needed cash to make new capital investments, such as buying additional sound-proofing and higher quality microphone equipment for recorded training, I had to wait for the cash payments to flow in. This was both unpleasant and unexpected when I signed the deals. Sure, I understood the theory from books and online learning, but when you experience it in your own business, you truly appreciate that cash is king. Fight to get paid sooner whenever you can.

## 8 Jun - How Not to Write a Book
My first foray onto the global scene was in the summer of 2016 when I self-published my first book. The topic was both highly technical and highly specialized. These aren't bad things per se, but the manner in which I developed the book was just plain stupid in retrospect.

I started writing the book in the summer of 2015 (on my honeymoon). I correctly identified a gaping hole in the market that my book could plug. I made a few early blunders. While the content of the book is first-rate and contains detailed information difficult to find elsewhere, the organization and flow of the book were rather haphazard. I failed to consider the books readability and laser-focused on the content, dissatisfying some customers. I impetuously cobbled together an outline and didn't think to change it.

At the time, I had no international following and no one with which I could collaborate. I didn't have any friends technically skilled in this topic area. Thus, the book did not receive any "quality checking" as it was being written, but only once at the end. I took three weeks vacation from my job over Christmas break to read the whole book and make small corrections. That was it. No technical peer review, no professional editing, and no external suggestions for improvement. As a result, the book has some confusing typos and errors of fact. All technical books do, but I'll admit this particular work has more than its fair share.

The book is roughly 3,000 pages in length. This was my biggest mistake. In reality, I wrote 4 or 5 books, and should have sold them individually or as a discounted volume set. A single 3,000-page book will be expensive, hard to digest, and slow for even today's computers and smartphones to open and search. With smaller books, I would have increased my sales since customers not interested in the entire body of work could select which volumes they wanted, paying only for those. I've lost out on thousands of dollars in sales as a result of poor product planning.

Although I was the first to market with a complete offering, I could have shown up much sooner with volume 1, then a month later with volume 2, and so on. This would have given me cash sooner (remember, money has a time value) and I would have enjoyed an even longer market dominance period.

The silver lining is that despite my foolishness, the book is a gem of a product and has topped the market for 3 whole years now. In retrospect, a little bit of business sense would have significantly advanced the book's success. For the techies out there, make sure you see beyond the ones and zeroes.

## 3 Aug - Hidden Costs
I am always astounded by how many purchasing departments measure costs. They are quick to break out their spreadsheet programs to tabulate the cost of parts, labor, freight, and capital. Inept Government officials do it, too. While the cost of capital helps approximate the ever-decreasing value of money over time, it doesn't account for other hidden costs: those of transaction and opportunity.

These are my two favorite costs to talk about because they intertwine in interesting ways. I think of them differently than an accountant would.

  - **Transaction cost** measures money spent to do something
  - **Opportunity cost** measures money lost by doing something else

In a sense, these two costs are sides of the same coin. They combine to form the overall cost of a choice, something I informally call **decision cost**. Consider buying a house. This action includes a variety of closing costs, such as realtor commissions, appraisals, title fees, and more. These are clearly transaction costs as they are not part of the product itself. The opportunity cost includes the decision to have not chosen another home, which could have been less expensive, in better condition, or any other variety of positive attributes now unavailable to you.

Now for a business example. Longtime readers know that I've discussed contentration risk regularly. Taking this idea to its natural conclusion, earning $100,000 via 10,000 customers each paying $10 would be an extreme dilution of risk. Retail business notwithstanding, imagine what it would take to manage such a large customer base. This includes relationship management, business problem familiarization, and administrative overhead to track individual sales cycles, write proposals, and the like. Clearly, these are transaction costs, some of which are quite invisible.

Now consider the opportunity cost. Instead of endless meetings with 10,000 small customers, you should be looking for larger customers who will buy more from you, and ideally in a low-maintenance way. In the US, no one wants to sort through 10,000 IRS 1099 forms. What else could you be doing with your time?

Intuition and personal experience (not mathematical rigor) suggest that transaction costs increase as the number of transactions increase. However, opportunity costs appear more parabolic and are maximized (that is, most expensive) when very few or very many actions are executed. The minimal total **decision cost** lies somewhere in between, and I've personally found success in the power of threes. If you write books or deliver training, find three publishers. If you are a consultant, find three loyal, long-term clients. If you're an employee, limit your concurrent project count to three.

Pursuing more opportunities increases your transaction costs, but common sense still applies. The biggest threat to controlling both of these costs is "yesmanship", a topic for another day.

## 20 Jul - American Colleges
Let's not waste time today. The cost of higher education in the United States is becoming oppressively expensive without a commensurate increase in quality, modernity, or relevance.

A bit of casual empiricism reveals that ballooning administrative staffs are largely to blame. As enrollment (demand) and tuition (price) grow together, clearly the university's top lines are rapidly increasing. Many colleges are nonprofits, and that extra revenue has to go somewhere. It sure isn't going towards hiring more full-time educators. Just by searching the Internet, I've found some questionable administrator roles which were recently added at one school:

  - Senior Vice Provost for Instructional Innovation
  - Director of Institutional Effectiveness
  - Associate Provost for Institutional Research and Effectiveness

Though I've not worked in academia, my observations also indicate that many professors are stuck as adjuncts. They are basically part-time disposable contractors with little incentive to excel or display loyalty to the institution. Why pour your soul into research and development for a school that sees you as expendable? I'm sure the bloated administrative staff is behind it, citing the costs of full-time and/or tenured educators.

The problem is exacerbated as a result of reduced Federal and State funding for schools. Amazingly, at the same time, the Federal Government continues to lend vast sums to high-risk, poorly capitalized borrowers (i.e., teenage students) with no collateral. There's even a thing called "strategic default" for students that know they cannot repay. What a great way to enter young adulthood.

As a father, this bleak outlook has me less than excited about my daughter attending college in the traditional sense. Even today, there are many alternative learning paths via trade-based certifications, online learning, workshops, and good old-fashioned reading. Everyday, college in the US seems less attractive from an ROI standpoint.

## 13 Jul - Good Debt
I've heard many different explanations around what qualifies as "good debt". Sometimes the answer is "nothing" and sometimes the answer is "everything". I think Robert Kiyosaki's definition from his 2015 book "Cashflow Quadrant" provides the best answer.

I have a penchant for pithy and contrarian opinions, which may influence what follows. Kiyosaki keeps it simple:

  - Bad debt is debt that **you** pay
  - Good debt is debt that **other people** pay for you

By this definition, almost all forms of debt can be classified as bad debt. Car loans, primary residence mortgages, revolving credit loans, home equity loans, and even small business loans when your personal assets are posted as collateral. If you are paying debt from your wages, commissions, or any other form of income that requires direct labor, it's bad debt.

I can think of two examples of good debt. Mortgages on rental properties that are paid by tenants is the example Kiyosaki uses. Just know that leverage cuts both ways and poor cash flow could topple your entire real estate investing strategy. Corporate financing, whether through bank loans or bonds, is another form of good debt when done responsibly. True, the company is paying for it, but it's ultimately revenue from sales. You could argue the customers are paying for that debt, and the company's managers are not personally responsible for the balance. This action is simply a transfer of funds across space and time for the sole purpose of business investing, **not** for satisfying a personal desire.

I'd elaborate on good debt by saying that borrowing money to increase a potential return on investment (i.e. leverage) is a reasonable decision worthy of serious consideration. If you are borrowing money to buy a wedding ring or other status artifact, you've missed the point.

Many people my age borrow money to pay for everything from luxury cars to new carpets. Alternatively, Dave Ramsey opposes debt financing for everything except 15 year fixed-rate mortgages. Opinions on debt classification run far and wide. I'm not telling you how to think, but I suggest you try to draw your own conclusions by thinking critically about what debt really is.

## 30 Mar - Win Together
The name of this blog is sure to rile up the cynical folks in the crowd and perhaps drive you one step closer to nihilism. I want to provide a few simple examples of winning together in the business world, and specifically, **beyond company boundaries**.

I sign business deals with a variety of different companies. Some are hegemons in their industry. Others are niche players. In every single case, I have a few representatives with which I interact regularly. Implicitly or explicitly, I **always** try to figure out how that representative is evaluated. Their personal evaluation matters to me. This is not about brown nosing. It's about trust. It's about winning friends and influencing people, much like the title of a 1936 book written by Dale Carnegie.

I recently signed my third deal with a popular and growing training company. One rep told me that they are evaluated on how quickly they can publish the content I produce out to market. Knowing this, I worked hard to deliver my content far ahead of schedule and with a level of quality beyond what was expected. I regularly checked in with them, using humor, to ensure they would "look good" in front of their bosses. I'll let you guess how quickly my content was published, how quickly I was paid, and how interested the company was in signing me on for repeat business. Paraphrasing the consulting guru Alan Weiss, "Behind every company objective is a personal objective."

With another company, after signing a contract to provide content on a topic in which I consider myself an expert, the rep suggested that I draft another proposal. This request was regarding a topic in which I was reasonably strong but for which I was not well known. The rep argued that sales would be excellent, even better than the first delivery of content to which we previously agreed. Given a small royalty percentage, I stood to gain some, but I could tell by the excitement in this person's voice that there was a significant benefit for this individual personally. I signed the deal. It worked out well for me, too. What do you think happened the next time I submitted a proposal on a highly competitive topic? Two days later, I had a signed contract and a grant payment clearing their accounts payable system.

Zero-sum thinking is the scourge of modern business relationships. Don't do it.
