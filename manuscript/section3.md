# Sales and Marketing
Selling is among the oldest of professions. I truly believe that all people are salespeople, and I've been trying to improve my selling game. I'm less interested in Hollywood-style closing techniques and more interested in the softer topics like ethics, trust, and relationships. I also include some practical tips based on my own sales experience.

## 10 Aug - The Ansoff Matrix
While listening to a "Great Courses" business book on marketing, I was introduced to the Ansoff matrix. It's a simple 2x2 matrix that intersects customers, new and existing, with products, new and existing. I wanted to talk about the Ansoff matrix as it relates to my personal business offerings. I'd encourage you to repeat the exercise for yourself.

```
+----------+-------------+-----------------+
|          | Existing    | New             |
|          | Customers   | Customers       |
+----------+-------------+-----------------+
| Existing | Market      | Market          |
| Products | Penetration | Development     |
+----------+-------------+-----------------+
| New      | Product     |                 |
| Products | Development | Diversification |
+----------+-------------+-----------------+
```

If you decide to sell existing products to existing customers, this is **market penetration** and is the lowest risk approach if you can pull it off. I encourage those who attend my training sessions or watch my video-on-demand to sign up for more. These are customers who have already seen the quality of my work and are likely to return.

Selling existing products to new customers is **market development**, which requires more effort but may open up new markets you didn't consider before. This includes promotional campaigns for a popular technical book I wrote years ago, which no sane person would buy twice. This attracts new readers.

If you decide to develop new offerings for existing customers, this is **product development**, which carries greater risk as it is hard to forecast whether customers will buy it. In early 2019, I converted a traditional book into "book as code" with tooling that I pioneered. I also recorded a YouTube video on its creation. The book already had about 50,000 readers and I was targeting the same people.

Last, developing new products for sale in new markets is called **diversification** and is the riskiest move of all. Think of General Motors trying to sell chocolate bars. When I entered the network automation space and started creating open-source tools, it was completely new territory for me. Both the code and my knowledge of the network automation market was limited at the time. This turned out to be both a wise business and personal decision.

The goal of the Ansoff matrix is **not** to do all four, but to choose one. Sometimes it is appropriate to choose a different strategy for each offering as I attempted to do. I experimented with different things because I wanted to learn. Figure out your best path for business growth and aggressively pursue it.

## 29 May - Sales Ethics
Earlier this year, I consulted for an organization with about 8 independent data communications networks. Some of these networks were highly sensitive and warranted such separation, while others could, both technically and politically, be merged onto shared infrastructure. Such a hardware consolidation would reduce both capital and operating costs for the customer. Now, suppose you were a network device supplier staring at a 70% drop in revenue.

It is make-or-break situations like this that create the best salespeople. I say "best" because I've been on all sides of the selling game throughout my professional career. I've always admired salespeople who create win-win solutions that bring value to customers while meeting or exceeding their revenue commitments. I always pay close attention in any sales call regardless of which role I play.

I once worked at a company where increasing the quantity of products sold was the only way they knew how to make money. The products were good but the quantities being sold, in some cases, were far beyond what the customer could realistically use. True, the customer did place an order for the products and there was nothing illegal about the deal, but the account team knew it was far in excess of what was needed. Within a year, many of these products ended up in long-term storage, generating value for no one.

What would my ideal salesperson do in the scenario outlined earlier in this blog? First, acknowledge in no uncertain terms that the customer's design team is making the right decision to reduce cost and hardship by consolidating their many disparate networks. Then, ask how you can be part of the solution. Offer suggestions for products that would fit their need, and perhaps offer professional services to help with the design, testing, and implementation. Offer your best security technology to supplant the former air-gapped design. Make money from **new** offerings designed to solve the customers **new** problem. Pushing old products or resisting change just strengthens customer stereotypes around sales people. Be actively part of that solution and maintain the long term trust you've hopefully built over many years. And remember: customers love to buy but hate to be sold.

This scenario is still playing out today, and I'm rooting for the sales team to do right by the customer and their parent company through ethical selling.

## 19 Oct - Innovation
In the late 1990s when I was in middle school, my school held annual "Invention Fairs". Students were instructed to create new products to solve some existing problem. Looking back 20 years later after never personally succeeding at these events, I realized it was never about innovation or creativity.

Instead, the school was introducing us to **entrepreneurism at a young age**. The true goal was to emphasize solving real-life personal and business problems, not fabricated ones. Ironically, this happens in real life today as companies are constantly developing solutions looking for a problem. Sometimes the right approach is less innovation and more market analysis, pragmatism, and good old "business sense".

One of my inventions was a bookmark with a reading light. It was a thin piece of scrap copper with a battery mounted on the back. It sported a small light mounted on a semi-flexible arm. It was fun to make with my father's help. However, it was heavy, fragile, and relatively expensive. The word "bookmark" should have given it away; they mark your position in a book. You don't often leave them in the book while reading. Needless to say, I rightly received no accolades for the idea.

One of my friends invented "The Pick" which was a small metal pin that was tucked in your sneakers. You could use it to scrape mud off your shoes. This was a little more realistic, but not something most adults would ever buy. He also lost. Both this product and the bookmark were innovative solutions for which the industry had no direct equivalents. We approached innovation by taking too narrow of a view and focused only on invention.

By now, you are wondering who won. Each year they picked the top 5 ideas. The kids would present their ideas to real-life venture capitalists, although I'm sure the process was less brutal than on TV. Fourth place was "Store-o-Steps" invented by another friend. Basically, it allowed stair tops to rotate upwards on hinges, much like a cupboard. You could store items inside and he wisely marketed this as perfect for urban construction. First place went to two girls who teamed up to invent the "Car Kit". It was basically a first aid kit with some added goodies like flares, food, and a whistle. Similar roadside assistance products are everywhere today and it's a sizable industry. Not very creative, but highly practical.

Startups fail constantly because someone has a bright idea that solves a problem no one has. Some people understand this as kids, but slowpokes like me realized it years later.

## 6 Jul - Ideas are Commodity
One of my favorite quotations is "Ideas are commodity. Execution of them is not" by Michael Dell. It's a frontal assault on the falsehood that big ideas alone make the world go 'round. Everyone has ideas. Literally, everyone. Putting those ideas into practice is what matters.

In terms of startup businesses, Eric Ries offers a comical perspective in his book "The Lean Startup" published in 2012. He challenges readers to **try** to get someone, such as a competitor, to steal one of your bright ideas. Chances are they won't even call you back. They are loaded with ideas and are struggling to decide which ones to pursue. The constraint is with practical execution. According to US copyright law, one cannot copyright ideas or concepts, and rightfully so.

I once worked with an engineer at a large US Government customer who I considered to be both a thought leader and a conman. His ideas were modern, well-explained, and expertly sold to top management. This guy could sell salt to a slug. If he were not so unscrupulous, he'd make a great account manager. Anyway, he never successfully deployed anything, but arrayed his "fall guys" like dominoes to take the heat when the efforts inevitably failed. By that time, he was already peddling a new fad. Those at the bottom (us) saw through the charade but executives praised his brilliant ideas. So much for that.

What matters is the daily grind, the nitty gritty work that it takes to build a business. Paraphrasing Ries again, it isn't the theoretical whiteboard session or occasional late-night mental breakthrough. It's the core business functions, such as sales, marketing, product development, accounting, customer service, and countless more. Above all, it is testing hypotheses for correctness and taking appropriate action thereafter. This is unexciting, time consuming, and difficult. That's why the weak managers from my former job shied away from it and heralded half-baked pipe dreams instead.

Everything has to start with an idea, but the keyword is **start**. Don't pat yourself on the back until you build something off it. Ask yourself, "Does what I built deliver real-life value to anyone?" For an idea, the answer is always no. For a solution, the answer is maybe, and if you've done your homework, it should always be yes.

## 26 Oct - Sales Psychology

## 27 Jul - Forecasts
I'm always thrilled when I can find a bridge between books on completely separate topics. I've recently read Nassim Nicholas Taleb's 2012 book "Antifragile" and, coupled with my extensive research into Lean thinking and the Theory of Contraints (TOC), I've reinforced my opinion about forecasting.

Let's cover the easy stuff first. Former Lean Enterprise Institute CEO Jim Womack and TOC creator Eliyahu Goldratt claim, in no uncertain terms, that sales forecasts are worthless. Worse still, using the sales forecast as justification to buy parts "just in case" or to build goods to fill a warehouse ties up capital and hurts the company's cash flow. Both Lean and TOC suggest buying what you need based on customer demand. That is, buy parts at the same pace as sales volume, then build the product very quickly.

The Lean and TOC opponents of yesteryear used extensive "whataboutism" to discredit "just in time" inventories. Most of these scenarios revolved around catastrophic scenarios, some of which could be "black swans", or unknown unknowns. This line of argument is valid and Taleb addresses it, albeit indirectly.

Taleb explains in his book that predicting the future is impossible. He suggests building systems in such a way that they don't need forecasts to succeed. If you operate in a closed, non-improving environment where everything is efficient and seemingly predictable, you are vulnerable to black swan events. More than being robust, antifragile systems **must** improve with the introduction of randomness. At a component or product level, variation is undesirable, but I'm talking about the production process and its reaction to randomness.

Some may misinterpret Taleb and say "just in case" inventories are needed to protect against the randomness, and as such, are antifragile. Precisely the opposite is true. Burying process problems with spare parts, more employees, or other gimmicks is a prime example of non-linearity. This term describes a mismatch between effort and result. Doubling inventory in this way will most definitely **not** lead to a doubling of cash inflow, a halving of lead time, or any other such positive business outcome.

Ironically, "Lean" was almost named "Fragile" by its creators decades ago because it was susceptible to supply chain disturbances. I don't think Taleb would have classified it that way, since the spirit of lean is continuous process improvement, not "making the numbers".

## 22 Jun - Conferences
I love speaking at conferences, especially big ones with big crowds. It brings out the best in me and many other speakers I know. I think many speakers tend to forget what conferences are all about; entertainment.

A friend of mine was recently chosen to speak at Cisco Live for the first time. Like me, he understands the value in entertaining attendees and conducted some basic market research. On Twitter, he held a poll to ask what kinds of demonstrations he should do: live, recorded, a mix of both, or none at all. I was shocked to see less than 50% of respondents chose live demos. While still the most popular choice, I expected this number to be closer to 80%.

I was grateful for the unsolicited and useful explanations many voters offered on why they chose recorded demos. These helped confirm my hypothesis around two key behaviors. I feel quite confident people voted based not on what they wanted, but what they thought my friend wanted to hear.

  - They assumed conference attendees want "facts" only.
  - They assumed my friend was afraid of his demos failing in real-time.

These comments completely miss the mark as they are based on the assumption that conferences are like formal schooling. First, in school, students show up and learn primarily through lecture. All of us will agree, school was downright boring most days. Second, if you are afraid of your demo failing in real time, then your demo is poorly planned, your product/service is either faulty or you don't fully understand it, or you are simply afraid of what other people will think of you. I've had demos blow up in my face; stop being timid and own it. Demos with training wheels are not interesting for anyone.

Let me share a secret with you. **Conference attendees want and need to be entertained**. If people just wanted to learn a technology, they could find any number of discount training providers or watch the reruns on the Cisco Live website at no cost. I am not suggesting adding cheap, unrelated humor. When I was in US Marine training in late 2008, instructors would begin a lecture with a stupid video of some guy falling off a bike or Marines blowing something up. They would then launch into a poorly delivered "death by Powerpoint" session. Rather than applying real innovation to create interesting material, they prepended "attention getters" to the course which were worthless.

If you speak at a conference, just know that you an entertainer first. Your transmittal of facts should be the side effect of a great show, not the focus.

## 18 May - Consulting "Rates"
In consulting, the word "rate" implies measuring some quantity against units of time. Dollars per hour, meters per second, sick days per year, etc. For decades, the world-renowned consultant Alan Weiss has lambasted the use of time-based fees in consulting. I want to summarize his arguments using my own words, thought processes, and examples.

We bought a house in October 2018 as part of our family's wealth building strategy. We've paid professional contractors to complete many of the jobs for which my wife and I lacked the technical skills or tools required. In every case, the contractors arrived on time, completed the work to a satisfactory degree and very quickly, then billed me **exactly** what they estimated. Even when the plumber encountered a few fittings that took longer to remove than expected, the invoice didn't change. I hired them to solve a problem, that is, to **deliver an outcome or a result**. I couldn't care less how many hours it takes them to fix the problem, only that I want it done quickly and done right the first time.

Weiss claims (and I agree) that had these workers billed hourly, they would unquestionably be encouraged to work more slowly and do poor quality work so I'd have to call them back. This is why I act like an executive by hiring the best contractors who charge value-based fees that improve my condition. This is why I **do not** act like the purchasing department, completely removed from the company's strategic decision making but are wholly focused on stiffing their suppliers.

At the time of this writing, I am not a true independent consultant, but I currently write content for three different media companies. This is how I am compensated by each.

  - Fixed cash payment upon signing plus live attendance royalties.
  - Fixed cash payment upon completion plus video viewership royalties.
  - Fixed percentage of the company's top-line sales for six months.

Notice that **not one** of these approaches is time-based. You don't need to be a consultant to operate in the value-based compensation world. Yes, my royalties are based on how long people stay in my courses, but I am never paid based on how long it took me to build content. What executive would ever sign a media deal to reward those who deliver slowly? Don't allow companies to penalize you for effectively operating your business. Paraphrasing Weiss, focus instead on how you can bring incredible ROI to your customers and equitable compensation for yourself.
