# Time Management
I am ruthless with my time. A wise man once said "You can always make another dollar, but you cannot make another minute". I'm dedicating an entire section of this book to help detail how I manage my time and remain productive. This isn't a prescription, but rather, a description. You'll need a good plan, a positive attitude, and the right tools.

## 27 Apr - What is Your Time Worth?
I've written about the time value of money before, and I think all people have an innate understanding that time is money. Employees sell fixed units of time to their employers in return for fixed sums of money. When the time unit is one hour, we call this a wage. When its annual, we call it a salary. But what do we call spending (or losing) money in return for time? Unpaid vacation?

This blog isn't focused on the trivialities of terminology. Instead, I want to share my personal system on how I decide on which resource to expend (time or money) when confronting a problem. A colleague and I spoke about this just recently. His cutoff is $35 per hour. Using home improvement as a simple example, he will do the project himself if the total cost is more than $35 per hour, which includes materials. $35 or less, he pays someone to do it. He feels his discretionary time is worth $35 per hour and makes decisions based on it.

I love this system and have been using it for years. The only difference is that I add a gray area by using a range. My lower bound is $50, so anything less than this amount, I'll pay someone. The upper bound is $100, so anything more than this amount, I'll do it myself, assuming I have the know-how. These decisions are automatic and require little brain activity. What if the price falls somewhere in between? It depends, but the analysis is the fun part.

First and most obviously, $51 is a lot different than $99, so where the value falls in the range matters. Next, I look at my work forecast, both at my day job and my personal business. If I have many business commitments lined up and stand to make healthy gains, I'm more likely to outsource the plumbing job. If it's a slow season for business, it's more likely I'll dig out my pipe wrench. If all this seems salient to you, it should, because it's common sense.

The main point is that if you don't manage your time according to a set of governing principles, like societal laws, anarchy reigns. Guard your time unapologetically.

## 2 Feb - Busy is the New Lazy
Perhaps a controversial topic, but an important one. All sectors of all industries have their share of eternally "busy" people. They peck away at their laptops during strategic meetings, dial into back-to-back conference calls, and contort themselves into cogs that fit perfectly into the machine that preserves the status quo.

Many management books describe a 2x2 matrix that classifies tasks by their importance (important or not) and urgency (urgent or not). Items that are both urgent and important are crises which should be rare, assuming your business is well-run. Perhaps unintuitively, these items should **not** be the primary focus. Instead, we must focus on the "important but not urgent" tasks. These are the long-term projects and "rocks", as described by Gino Wickman's Entrepreneurial Operating System, that are critical for success.

Here are some examples of "important but not urgent" tasks. Note that more specific details such as dates, assignees, and measurables would exist for a real business; these are simplified examples. None of these will happen overnight, and all require constant effort.

  - Develop network operations playbook for client cutovers
  - Streamline network configuration management via CI/CD
  - Deploy NFV for customized service delivery and reduced lead time
  - Improve inventory turns by X-fold to bring Y% increase in profitability

Any tasks that are not important, regardless of their urgency, need to be minimized or eliminated altogether. There is a reason why the term "busy work" has a well-deserved negative connotation. Those who prioritize busy work as important work are lazy by any objective measure. As described by one colleague: "If we take away their useless makework, it reveals their laziness. Suddenly, they have no excuse for not doing the work that really needs doing."

When I travel for work, I like to focus on the tasks that require my presence on site. For example, physically setting up equipment, mentoring people, and other tasks that cannot be done remotely. I know some who sit in their hotel rooms until 10 AM on conference calls, then show up on-site and crack open their laptops to begin emails, Powerpoints, and more conference calls. Don't forget the 2 hour lunch breaks. Why are you even on travel? Nevermind, I forgot, you're "busy".

## 1 Jun - Procrastination
If you came here looking for motivational advice, you might as well stop reading now. I'm not going to try to inspire you to do the things you know you should be doing. I'm going to take a more analytical approach. The antidote to procrastination is **strategic thinking**. Be deliberate with what you will and will not do.

Name for me one problem that gets better over time. Just one. We all intuitively know that there are no such problems. I frequently write about my house, because when we took possession of it in October 2018, it needed substantial improvement. The upstairs bathroom exhaust fan terminated in the attic, not outside through a vent. Rerouting it to the gable vent cost about $20 in materials and one hour of time. I seriously considered ignoring it, until I estimated the cost of removing future mold. The house also had defective polybutylene plumbing, which cost $770 to replace and about four hours of time. Had the pipes burst, repair costs would have been ten times that amount and my family would have to vacate during repairs, incurring additional lodging cost. Problems get harder and more expensive to fix when left unaddressed.

In the professional arena, procrastination seems less catastrophic. It was 4pm on a Friday when I received a non-urgent email from a fellow engineer I did not personally know. He needed help deploying a specific networking technology in which I had mastered. I called him immediately, we talked it through for about ten minutes, and that was the end of it. I considered waiting until Monday. Why wait? Would that be in his best interest? What about the customer he was likely supporting? What possible advantage would be gained by waiting?

Another twist is to the consider the "growth mindset". I've written about the time value of money before and why a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. When measuring discretionary time, I consider it the opposite. Assuming that you are "growing" (focusing more on your business, writing more music, etc.), your future time will become more scarce and thus more valuable. If you procrastinate, you are only robbing your future self.

## 16 Mar - Kanban vs. Scrum
This comparison has been beaten to death on the Internet by people much smarter on these topics than I. I'll briefly review both and explain how I've seen these methodologies work firsthand **outside** of software development.

Scrum identifies a fixed number of work tasks to be completed within a given time window, called a sprint. The process begins with sprint planning, which identifies tasks in scope for a given sprint. At the end of the sprint, all tasks brought from the backlog into the sprint should have been completed. After the sprint, the customer should "gain value" from the completed tasks. Scrum constrains batch size using time, typically 2 to 4 weeks per sprint.

Kanban, in my view, is simpler. There is no concept of a fixed time interval (that is, no sprint). Instead, work tasks move from the "To Do" state, to the "Work In Process" state, to the "Done" state. Work tasks should **only** flow in one direction. The key to Kanban is limiting the amount of work in process, typically to a small number of tasks. This means that whenever a single task is done, customer value can conceivably be delivered faster.

I personally haven't managed a scrum team, but have participated as a member on a systems engineering team. The team leader would ask individuals which tasks they were going to complete in the sprint. Sometimes tasks were assigned in a top-down fashion. For the next 2 weeks, no one was allowed to work on anything outside of the sprint's scope. It was a reasonably effective method.

I use two kanban boards in my personal life. One tracks my personal tasks which includes my business commitments and big-ticket administrative items. The second is for the work on our house. We bought a house in late 2018 and spent 2 months fixing it up. We completed 76 projects during that period, averaging more than 1 per day. Kanban limited us to a maximum of 2 concurrent projects, period, no exceptions. These ranged from painting to installing GFCI outlets to replacing water supply plumbing. Some took one hour, some took several days. My wife and I were encouraged to simply "move cards from left to right as fast as possible".

There is more to Kanban than just tracking work tasks. One of my favorite attributes of the method is that it surfaces problems. This comment rates its own blog post, so I'll discuss it another time. In the meantime, you've got nothing to lose by trying Kanban. Just play by the golden rule: do not start new work until the existing work is complete.

## 13 Apr - The Real Power of Kanban
I've written about kanban before, and many of you know that I use it extensively in my personal and professional lives. In my 16 March 2019 blog about kanban and scrum, I ended by saying kanban surfaces problems. What does that really mean?

Ignore the fancy web interfaces of kanban in the tech space. Think of kanban as a nondescript pull system. You only produce when the downstream work station tells you to. It is therefore impossible to overproduce. Compare it to a push system, where parts are forced into the process to keep everyone busy with no alignment to market demand or sales volume. Let's assume you see the obvious flaws with push systems and want to introduce kanban as a remedy.

Suppose you decree that all work stations shall use kanban. Great. Halfway through the work process, a task gets stuck. Maybe a part is missing, or a developer isn't available for a code review, or whatever else. This is where the proverbial "rubber meets the road". Weak leaders would cover up the problem by adding inventory with the goal of meeting production target quantities. "We are missing parts? That means we need to stockpile more parts here". In the service industry, they'd have the half-finished task sit on the back burner while they started a new task to buoy efficiency measurements.

Strong leaders would ask "Why is that work station not able to produce?" or "Why is that developer not available?" The answer is likely to be difficult and uncomfortable; it will almost always necessitate organizational change. This is always harder than a technical tweak or feature introduction. To paraphrase my "The Soul of a Slave" post, leaders see process improvement as a series of problems and solve them. Inventory isn't a source of waste, but rather a result of waste.

I've never worked in network operations full time, but spent much of 2017 and 2018 helping a massive bureaucracy run a global network. I regularly checked the team kanban board to see how quickly work tasks were moving. I also regularly observed tasks getting stuck in the "doing" column because key people weren't around or customer information was missing. The push system answer is "Just start another task to stay busy" while the lean thinker (and honestly, the principled leader) asks "How can we overcome this problem to improve our process?" Kanban showed us the waste and we ignored it.

## 9 Mar - How to Read More
 In late 2017, I was struggling to understand some of the core concepts underlying DevOps technologies. I knew deep down that I simply did not have time to sit and read traditional books. Some of you are saying this is an excuse. With a full time job, a wife that works full time, and a 1 year old daughter at the time, it just wasn't going to happen. Both my wife and I are regular gym-goers and aren't willing to sacrifice that. Many of you have followed me on the web for years and know how much I contribute to the community, and I'm not willing to tune that down, either. I had to find a way to keep expanding my knowledge without investing more time.

First, I tried podcasts. I found a popular DevOps podcast. I had high hopes, but was quickly turned off when the podcasters, within 10 minutes of the episode starting, veered far off course. The conversation went from technology to the biological differences between men and women ... and after 5 full minutes of irrelevant and unactionable banter, I wrote them off. How could anyone enjoy listening to this nonsense?

Next, I tried audiobooks. This is the single best decision I have made in all of 2017. Through 2018, I read approximately 100 books (including re-reads) for a total of 37 days listening time. That's more than 10% of the total time in a year, roughly 900 hours. Here's why I love audiobooks:

  - They are fun, and some books have extraordinary actors and actresses
  - You can listen while commuting, exercising, or doing chores
  - You can carry several books on your mobile phone

Some critics claim that if you are engaged in another activity, say, folding laundry, then listening to an audiobook while doing it is less effective than deep, focused reading. That's probably true. It's most definitely true when listening to highly technical or nuanced content. My point is to capitalize on the time you've already invested by adding in **some** educational value. Just read the book 2 or 3 times to compensate. Don't overthink it. It's free to re-read them, both in terms of money and time. You'll be surprised how much time you spend commuting, doing chores, and other activities that leave your ears (and frankly, your mind) ready for action.

## 23 Oct - Advanced Tactics
When I enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 2004, I did so as an assaultman. This is an infantry role with a specialization in small-scale demolitions and rocket launchers. To an 18-year-old, this sounded pretty cool. One thing I totally underestimated about the military was their focus on "brilliance in the basics" in everything they do.

While assigned to the east coast Infantry Training Battalion, we spend endless hours disabling our shoulder-mounted assault weapons, computing how much C4 or TNT would be needed to blast through different materials, and other relatively boring tasks. I watched our machine gun section practicing "gun drills", which consisted of sprinting, throwing yourself on the ground, and rapidly deploying the crew-served weapon. Most of us, myself included, wanted to start kicking in doors and shooting at abandoned tanks. Our instructors wisely counseled us that these skills would come later, and easily, once we mastered the fundamentals of our craft.

I hadn't really thought about those military days until recently when I picked up the 2018 book "The Dichotomy of Leadership" by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. At one point during their pre-deployment workup, Babin mentions his SEALs wanted to focus on "advanced tactics" rather than fundamentals. One of my favorite tenets from Willink and Babin is "simple, not easy". Shooting, moving, and communicating are core skills for any combatant.

The logic extends far past combat. In software development, I consider "unit testing" to be a basic skill that is sorely lacking today, especially in Government-owned software. I know several eager engineers wanting to add multi-threading, fancy web front-ends, and third-party integrations before designing a component-level test process. I learned this lesson the hard way in 2006 when I wrote a C# program to manage music on my MP3 player. I once made a minor change to one of my core libraries. Lacking regression tests, running the program deleted all my music from the device. I was able to restore the files from an offline backup, but it made me think about what "could" have happened.

It applies in manufacturing as well with basic Lean tenets like "quality at the source". These concepts are simple, but not always easy. It takes time, know-how, patience, and commitment, especially as your workload increases. Identify the foundational tasks in your own life and focus there, even when it isn't fun.

## 26 Jan - Cleaning with Lean
At Cisco Live US 2018, attendees could volunteer to support an effort known as "Clean the World". Volunteers would create support packages for the world community where sanitation is poor or nonexistent. I always volunteer for things like this because it is good for humanity and doesn't take much time.

We assembled two separate products. One was a generic hygiene kit with soap, shampoo, washcloths, a comb, toothpaste, and a toothbrush. The other was a female-specific package that had fewer washcloths but added sanitary pads. Both were packed into 1 gallon zip-top plastic bags for delivery. Volunteers were to walk down a row of tables, collecting the required quantities of each item from bins, then place them into the bags. At the end of the line, the bag was placed into a large cardboard box.

Turnout was great and I enjoyed myself. I quickly became dismayed, though, at the "large batch" mindset of some volunteers. Some individuals were trying to fill 2 or 3 bags at the same time, stopping at each station for at least 2 or 3 times longer than needed. I watched many fumble, drop, and generally struggle to fill their bags this way. As a lean thinker, I only ever filled one bag at a time, and ended up waiting behind the slower "mass producers".

I stayed for about 30 minutes, so I saw peaks and lulls in participation. During a lull, I timed how long it took me to fill one bag. I was able to move so fast that **I never even stopped walking** while filling the bags. It took me about 10 seconds to fill one bag. I timed some of the faster mass producers filling 2 bags at once, and it took them 23-27 seconds each time. They had to come to a full stop at each bin, pick up more items from each bin, and place them into more bags. They also had to pick up and put down individual bags constantly, slowing them even more. I even saw some people get the quantities wrong because they would put 2 shampoo bottles in one bag and 0 in another, leading to time-consuming rework. I hope it is clear that filling 1 bag every 10 seconds versus 2 bags every 23 seconds (at best) is unquestionably the better way to produce.

Now tell me again, why are you multitasking at work? Why are you doing 6 months of development and then testing/integrating at the very end? Why are you copy/pasting massive "spray and pray" router configs into the shell? Start thinking about maintaining a smooth delivery flow and it will change your life.

## 11 May - Quality is Free
In his 2013 book titled "Gemba Walks", 2nd edition, Dr. Jim Womack makes the statement that "quality is free". The claim is made within the context of a manufacturing environment where rework (the process of repairing defects on products just built) is far more expensive than doing it right the first time. Womack is not alone. Phillip Crosby's 1979 book "Quality is Free" coined the term.

Intuitively, most of us know this. We also assume that doing things right the first time requires a larger upfront investment, more time planning, or both. I've written previously about "good, cheap, fast" and how, in some cases, the "pick two" logic simply doesn't hold true. As one quality assurance executive said: "the cost of good quality is the cost of the process. It is cheap if the process fits the design and people can execute the process." This implies that the product design, production steps, and process executors (i.e., the people) must all work in harmony to keep the cost of good quality down.

Suppose you and I are working on some software together. Should we pair up and work together or code independently to increase our output? The concept of "pair programming" suggests the first option is superior. Some unofficial, unsubstantiated data suggest that programmers are 15% slower when working in pairs but have 15% fewer defects. So it sounds like an equal trade-off between time and quality, right?

That's superficially true, but this choice is a no-brainer. The cost of producing code that works most of the time (but has bugs) is generally low. The 15% reduction in defects regularly translates into lower total costs, even when accounting for the slower pace of work. Having worked in manufacturing as a young man, I saw highly paid engineers reworking defective, half-built products. I knew their cost to the plant was more than a handful of assembly and test technicians like me. Maybe 15% more line workers contributing to this process would bring smoother flow and fewer defects, reducing the demand for expensive rework.

Make no mistake, the time value of money definitely plays a role here, not to mention the importance of being early to deliver products in emerging markets. I understand all that. However, I cannot recall a single personal example where after-the-fact poor quality costs were less than the "doing it right" costs. I'm also not bashing the concept of "minimum viable products" designed to validate business assumptions. I am simply claiming that rework is expensive and that, if you build it right the first time, quality costs nothing. Think about it.

Quality is conformance to requirements, not goodness or gold-plating. Put another way, quality is doing what you said you were going to do.
