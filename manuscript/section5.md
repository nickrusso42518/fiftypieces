# Failures
This section contains a combination of my own personal blunders and the destructive behavior of others that negatively affected me. In all cases, there was always an emotionally hard lesson that I learned from the event. I'm not too proud to share these events as they've helped me grow as a person.

## 20 Apr - It's Too Complex
I'll come out strong; **I hate this excuse**. It's a thinly veiled attempt at propping up what is likely a failing status quo mindset around a challenging problem. Now, with that out of the way, let's examine why people say it.

I'm guilty of it myself. People fear what they don't understand, but in the tech industry, we conveniently label it "complex" or "risky". Long ago, even as a Computer Science degree holder, I was convinced that large-scale network automation would just melt down networks faster given the increased blast radius. While this does happen, there are a lot of brilliant countermeasures, like continuous integration (CI). If I'm being honest, I was worried about losing my job as a networking expert. I hated that my copy/paste Notepad skills would be made obsolete by an entry level programmer with basic CLI knowledge. About three years ago, I realized that we cannot just continue to memorize device commands if we collectively want to advance how our industry operates.

More recently, I teamed up with a sharp 22 year old on a network provisioning project. The goal was to take a system from zero to hero in about an hour, including software installation, hardening, configuration, licensing, and connectivity checking. Though the solution worked nicely and was successfully demonstrated many times, the dinosaurs from a previous era worked hard to marginalize it. They saw it as a threat to their existence. I loved their post hoc rationalization:

- It doesn't work (was observed working in real time).
- It required too many cables (only four short Ethernet jumpers).
- The syntax is too difficult.

Here's the syntax, modified to protect customer data. I'm confident any English-speaking person age 10 or older can read or edit it accordingly. Just populate the relevant fields with specific values, and type "make".

```

city_name: rochester
node_id: 1234

The battle rages on. Are you evaluating solutions based on their business value and merits, or callously rejecting what terrifies you?

## 14 Sep - Why?
I try to stay active on social media by contributing meaningfully to discussions. This often takes the form of asking people why they think or feel the way they do. Unfortunately, asking "why" is seen as a challenge in modern society for reasons I'll never understand.

Earlier this year, I asked a world-famous developer why one of his newer projects was not seeing the rapid adoption he anticipated. I read his blog post on why he decided to archive the project. I tweeted to him, asking if perhaps consumers just didn't see the utility of the solution? Maybe it was a value proposition or marketing problem and not a product problem? He immediately became defensive and delivered a scathing personal attack in reply. I wasn't angry, but vowed not to engage with him again.

One of my friends saw the conversation as it occurred. He sent me an unsolicited but appreciated consolation message. Paraphrased, my friend said "people often cannot tell the difference between someone talking **to** them versus talking **at** them." Kevin Hart used the words **"with"** and **"against"** in his 2017 book "I Can't Make This Up" when discussing how he repaired his relationship with his ex-wife. When someone asks you "why", don't assume you are being challenged. "Why" is often a deferential question; it's a request for information from an eager listener.

At Toyota, managers are instructed to ask "the five whys" to identify the root cause of a problem. The manager shows respect to the employee by asking "why", effectively saying "you are closer to the problem than I am, and I cannot resolve this alone." Employees often ask clarifying questions, which also shows respect, implying "you have strategic business context that I lack, which is why you are engaging with me." Prosecutors notwithstanding, people often ask "why" from a position of ignorance and curiosity. They seek advice and knowledge from those with more experience, wisdom, or skill than they do.

Without "why", there can be no true engagement. Human interaction is supposed to be more than people talking about how great they are all the time. Stop seeing every "why" as a threat and start answering it as the thoughtful inquiry it probably is.

## 31 Aug - Rejection
A few months ago, I submitted a proposal on a technical topic for which I am certain there is a market. Initially, the prospect was excited about it. I hurried to build a course scenario and develop my plan. The prospect then forwarded my proposal to a technical reviewer, and that's when things got interesting.

The reviewer felt the course was "too niche" and used this exact phrase three times in almost as many sentences. He suggested a much more expansive course, both in depth and breadth, using one of his own deep dive courses as a point of comparison. Being honest, I felt like he completely missed the purpose of my proposal, which was meant to meaningfully tie multiple technologies together to solve a specific business problem that few understand today. Talking about tools in isolation, as he suggested, has never interested me.

The prospect, a long-time business partner and respected peer, agreed with his assessment and asked me to resubmit. I didn't have the technical acumen on this particular topic to create a comparable product to what the reviewer suggested. I looked him up; he had a decade of experience on this specific technology where I had about two years. He had many other courses focused on nothing but this topic domain. It would be quite unwise for me to pursue the opportunity further given the enormous time investment required.

I wasn't angry at anyone, but it was my first business rejection. I waited a few days to reply so I could collect my thoughts. I wrote a genuine and unambiguous response to the editor, praising the reviewer's technical superiority and directness of his criticism. Bashing him would be petty and unprofessional. I admitted I was not at his level in this particular vertical. It would be a poor business decision for me to pour tremendous effort into a course that would not yield a justifiable ROI for me. I'm often willing to deliver courses outside my comfort zone, but this was simply not worth it.

The silver lining is that I was already nearing my "red line" and losing this contract was probably a blessing in disguise. Don't say yes to crazy assignments. I kept the door open because, as I gain experience in this field, I will someday have the chops to profitably deliver it.

## 21 Sep - Trolls vs. Contrarians
Those who follow this blog regularly know that I have many controversial opinions and personal habits. I try to stay descriptive, not prescriptive, giving readers the benefit of deciding for themselves what to believe. Some people were so disturbed by my writing that they labeled me a troll.

I immediately became thoughtful and looked at it from their perspective. Examining only the written text, trolls and contrarians may appear indistinguishable to the untrained eye. Both swim upstream from popular opinion and common practice. Both intend to catalyze activity that would have otherwise not occurred. However, there are two key differences between trolls and contrarians: **intent and context**.

The intent of a troll is to incite anger and spark controversy with outcomes that often align to some ulterior motive. A troll's purpose is rooted in manipulation to convince people to think and act a certain way. As such, trolls choose their words carefully for maximum effect. In your newly formed rage, the troll usually tries to sell you something, usually an idea about a product, yourself, or the world. For these reasons, I consider all politicians (Government or corporate) to be trolls.

A contrarian seeks to expand horizons through dialogue. They don't tell you what to think, only what they think and why they think it. The best ones provide some explanation and examples behind their reasoning. Contrarians are often also trying to sell you something, like a new way of thinking or operating your business, but there isn't a backdrop of dishonesty. Worst case, they are selling a book or training course, but never a conspiracy theory backed by destructive rhetoric.

Trolling is malicious scheming designed to frustrate and divide. Contrarian opinions are designed to be thought provoking and constructive. It's really not that hard to see the difference. By definition, it's unlikely you'll frequently harmonize with contrarians; agreement is the exception, not the rule. This does not make us trolls.

## 2 Nov - Watch Officer
In December 2009, I took charge of a 60-man platoon of US Marines who specialized in military communications. Although I was a non-commissioned officer in the infantry before receiving my Lieutenant's bars, I was still green. I was completely unprepared for an unexpected deployment one month later.

In January 2010, a massive earthquake shattered the country of Haiti and my unit was one of many dispatched to the scene on 48 hours notice. Fortunately, I was unmarried with an appetite for adventure. It is customary in the military for primary staff officers, a group to which I belonged, to accompany the Commanding Officer anywhere he went. Our CO wanted to be on the ground in Haiti rather than on the ship. Roger that.

Our mission was humanitarian in nature. In our small command post consisting mostly of staff officers and some communications troops under my command, I was assigned as the Watch Officer for 4 hours per day. I wasn't given much guidance on how to do this, and the off-duty Watch Officers were not terribly interested in training me. A subordinate commander was running relief convoys and requested permission to alter his route and timeline based on road conditions. This action had region-wide significance.

I thought it was my job to make decisions on the CO's behalf. Taking initiative is basically what leaders do. I told him to proceed, then reported the event to the CO a few minutes later. The nearby senior officers ripped into me for my extraordinary transgression. The CO was merciful and silenced them, explaining to me that my job was to monitor, observe, assess, and inform. Decisions were to be made by him or his senior staff officers. Then, it was my job to help execute and centrally supervise those decisions. A common phrase used in the military is "good initiative, bad judgment", which was certainly appropriate that day.

I tell this story because it ties together a number of important lessons that I was very grateful to have learned as a 24-year-old junior leader. First, don't assume other people know how to do their jobs. Second, constructively guide others to overcome their failures. Third, give them another chance to succeed.

## 6 Apr - Well, Technically ...
We've all heard it. Maybe we've even partaken in it. Someone makes a comment that is generally correct or reasonably illustrates a point. Perhaps the statement was incomplete or too vague. Either way, the "well, technically" brigade comes out in force to pick your pithy remark apart with minutia. How to react?

I'll be honest, I hate when people do this to me. From my point of view, it feels like they are just showing off and trying to one-up me. I maintain a free Cisco evolving technologies book and once claimed that "NETCONF is to YANG as HTTP is to HTML". This phrase was so popular that internationally acclaimed networkers even tweeted it on Twitter because of its simplicity and conciseness.

Within hours, a tweet came in saying the claim was wrong, and provided some corrective technical advice. I didn't immediately reply. For a day or so, I was butt-hurt, my ego bruised. I got called out in front of thousands of people, some of which were my customers. I decided to dedicate a few minutes of my life to really think about it. In reality, **I was wrong**. I was writing a technical book and I was flat-out peddling a falsehood. I realized that my frustration was baseless. I needed to get over myself.

I reached out to the engineer who corrected me and sent him an alternative explanation, even mentioning in the book that I had been wrong. The engineer was extremely grateful that I had listened. He even praised my commitment to technical accuracy. He is a true expert on the topic whereas I was just learning it at the time. Imagine if I had started yet another Internet argument over it. That would surely have put my vanity and arrogance on display. This engineer was genuinely trying to help.

What happens when someone is truly trying to one-up you? That **does** happen; ask me how I know. I was listening to a highly technical audiobook back in 2013 which was about 25 hours long. The author was slightly inaccurate on a minor detail, not completely wrong. At a high-level, the statement was fine. I pounced at the opportunity to show this "senior" network guy who was boss. I fired off a tough-guy email raising his folly. I did not receive a reply, nor did I deserve one. My point is simple; know the difference between people legitimately trying to help you improve by taking constructive criticism (even if delivered curtly) and those just trying to instigate a pointless competition. Reply to and respect the former; ignore provocation with the latter.

## 23 Nov - Underestimation
At a large trade show this summer, I bumped into a man in an elevator who recognized my name. He introduced himself as if we were old pals but I honestly couldn't recall meeting him. About 5 minutes after the elevator ride, it hit me. I remembered him from an online chatroom trying to learn about IT operations automation. I figured he was a junior engineer just tinkering around. Oh, how wrong I was.

I later spent more time with him, often in social settings. I attended his presentation and his delivery was masterful, clearly expressing the value proposition of his offering. He was the head of product development at a venture capital backed startup. I initially thought he was a newbie because he was looking for use cases to integrate his product with existing industry solutions. My skeptical attitude was rapidly replaced with one of admiration.

He is about 8 years older than I am and has extensive experience in data communication networks. He continued to share some of the projects upon which he worked, and I realized that he was a legitimate entrepreneur. Long story short, his first company secured three funding rounds totaling about 50 million dollars. He sold his first company for about 150 million dollars. I was literally speechless.

Now at his second venture, he's looking to accomplish even bigger things with a product that could be industry changing. Obviously, he isn't in this for the money, but has loftier goals. Regrettably, I didn't think to ask him about his true vision. I recently read Elon Musk's biography, published in 2017, and there are many similarities between how these two men view the world.

To top it all off, during a keynote speech, both he and the founder of the company received an award from the conference organizers. I snapped a picture on my phone and celebrated the moment. I honestly don't think I have ever been more wrong about a person in my entire life. They've accomplished things I only dream about.

My respect for him ticked upwards each day and I realized how badly I had underestimated his talent. I'm not an ego-driven one-upper by any means, but it surfaced my ignorance in judging people based on a few Internet chatroom exchanges. Everyone in the world knows something you do not.
