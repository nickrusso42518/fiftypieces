# Code of Conduct
These are rules and ideas that govern my personal life. They span a wide variety of personal development areas and I don't mince words. Be warned that this isn't your standard "eat healthy and exercise" advice. Some readers will find these suggestions completely outrageous. In the words of Jocko Willink, "good".

## 4 May - Comfort Zone
Last spring, I saw the writing on the wall. My efforts to help a longtime customer build a world class service provider network finally paid off. The problem was, they didn't need me anymore, and quickly started to hold my opinions in progressively lower regard. Despite extraordinary operational impact and commensurate acclaim, I was unhappy. I felt disrespected and discarded. Renowned or not, I stayed long past my useful shelf life.

Within a week or so, I realized my feelings were totally unfounded. My personal growth and happiness is my responsibility alone, and I now see how unhealthy it is to get emotionally attached to work projects. I decided I needed to build an "armored mind", to reference David Goggins from his 2018 book "Can't Hurt Me". I started simple and cheap by taking cold showers.

Go ahead, look it up. Internet pundits tout its health benefits. Although I did experience slightly clearer skin and increased energy levels, this is too anecdotal to be seriously discussed. I don't care about the health benefits. I did it because now I had a tangible and consistent way to leave my comfort zone **every single day**. That's why I do it.

It's not that I love physical punishment. Being uncomfortably cold for five minutes a day with no risk to life or limb isn't that serious. I find that removing myself from the comfort zone **by choice** helps me adapt to forced removal necessitated by external forces. Owning your bad decisions is one thing. However, life is a constant and unforgiving force that acts upon you, and you will also be pushed into discomfort by other people and events.

To those who consume my blog, my free books, my live and recorded video training, and my open source software, look at the publication dates. Almost all of the work on these projects happened **after** the introduction of cold showers. Researching completely new technologies and writing about them is downright challenging. Programming in different languages, adding complex test pipelines to repositories, then having the spine to publicly teach it isn't for the faint of heart. Much of it has been criticized, too. See my blog titled "Well, Technically ..." if you want to see how I handled it.

Try cold showers for a month before you tell me I'm wrong.

## 23 Mar - The Soul of a Slave
"The soul of a free man looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and solves them, while the soul of a slave whines, 'What can I do who am but a slave?'" writes George S. Clason in his 1926 book "The Richest Man in Babylon". No, this is not a blog post on the heinous act of slavery. It's not a money talk, either. It's a blog post on overcoming problems using mankind's inherent gift; critical thought.

The deeper message behind Clason's entertaining story is one of mindset. I have little tolerance for those who blame their situation on circumstances beyond their control. Many readers probably think I'm going to give some motivational speech about how self-pity is bad and you need to toughen up and stop making excuses. Sure, I believe that. However, I've got my sights on something else.

**"We have always done it that way."** If you say this to me, or any of its equivalents like **"We can't change that"** or **"It's too hard to learn"**, I will immediately hold you in lower regard. That isn't an exaggeration. I say this to all the new mentees I take on. It's a big part of my personality. Change isn't always good, but if the old way is truly better, you'd better come up with a rational explanation. A few engineers that I deeply admired and considered friends muttered these limiting words to me about one year ago on a topic of great import. Our relationship was buoyed only by our collective focus on the work, but it deteriorated significantly. It's unlikely I will work with them again professionally.

Blind adherence to old ways is a tacit refusal to even acknowledge that a problem exists. If you don't see life as a series of obstacles, what is it then? What is it you actually do, if not to adapt and overcome? Most people can positively influence at least **some** of the bad things they experience. Even if you are not measurably empowered to improve your station in life (at work or otherwise) what would it take to do so? Own the fact that what you are doing right now is probably not the final answer.

At least some of Clason's Babylonian slaves had the courage and wherewithal to recognize the misery of their situation, and act. In the words of entrepreneur Dan Lok, "Lame people blame people."

## 29 Jun - Loser DNA
A friend of mine is big into Gary Vaynerchuk, so I decided to check him out. I was immediately attracted to his "I'm a winner and I don't care what you think" attitude. My favorite phrase from Vaynerchuk so far is "loser DNA".

He is really referring to people with fixed mindsets rather than growth mindsets. I've blogged about this before in "The Soul of a Slave" but I want to unpack the term "loser DNA" further. I want to try and connect it to the impostor syndrome that many world-class engineers I know (i.e. my friends) suffer from.

Given the rate of change in our industry, everyone single one of us sees things we don't understand every single day. We feel like impostors when we are asked to participate in a panel discussion in front of 100 people alongside some of the sharpest minds in our industry on topics that are still relatively new to us. Scary, right?

Don't let it be. Even before I started learning from Vaynerchuk, I stopped comparing myself to other people. No, this isn't some Kumbaya "everyone has strengths" post. Surely that is true, but if you subscribe to that thinking with the **sole purpose of excusing yourself from growing, then you implicitly admit you're a loser.** Straight up loser DNA. You'll live in your comfort zone as a Twitter activist and wonder why everyone else is beating you in whatever you measure yourself against.

Admittedly, I suspect everyone struggles with this. A few days ago, a friend who is an expert software developer vented his frustration with me. I had been participating in public coding forums and, by his account, was not adding much value. Honestly, he was right, but it triggered my loser DNA. I think we all have it, it is simply a matter of whether you allow it to be dominant or recessive. I asked myself, should I really be in this field? After some reflection, I answered yes. I simply need to shut up do better. In reality, this friend did me a favor in a very indirect way.

You and I cannot know everything. Don't try. Grow your depth and breadth of knowledge but don't compare yourself to others. This is purely a self-esteem issue.

## 2 Mar - My Secret To Success
I'm not going to hold anything back. **Get rid of your television.** Being entertained via TV programming is probably the most passive activity in the world, except for sleeping. I'm not knocking it because it is physically lazy (although it certainly is), but rather because it has the capacity to completely transform someone's life in a negative way.

I was a big gamer as a kid. It kept me indoors on nice days, kept me relatively small and weak, made me socially awkward, and honestly, kept me stupid. I received good grades in school because I was a good test taker, a stroke of good fortune that would **not** work in college. I regularly watched many movies and TV shows, too. Around 2002, I was working three minimum wage jobs and was unable to afford gas money to drive to all of them. I sold my TV for about $50 so I could keep working another few weeks. When the money ran out, I started biking to work. I was so busy that I did not notice the TV was gone. I also did not notice how my life started to improve in almost every measurable dimension. I started to become mentally and physically tough, traits that would serve me well as a US Marine. I wasted less of my own precious time, freeing up more time to focus on programming projects as a Computer Science student. I'll stop here since I think you get the point.

For those trying to grow your business or personal brand, why do you enjoy watching other people get rich? If you love sports so much, why are you idolizing those on TV when you could be shooting hoops yourself? Can you think of **anything** else that helps you unwind? Perhaps, something more mentally active, like playing with your children, writing a blog post, or tinkering with new technology? I like to plop down and relax like everyone else, but I do so in silence to rest my racing mind, or perhaps while reading an exciting book. Oh, for what it's worth, when I met my wife in 2012, she didn't own a TV either, and we have never looked back.

I know there are many great educational TV programs out there, especially documentaries. But don't lie to yourself; chances are you seldom watch them. This was my excuse for a long time, too, and I know firsthand how easy it is to self-rationalize a bad decision. If you have young kids, I understand that TVs may be unavoidable, and I'm not going to tell you how to raise your offspring. But I would implore you, as an adult, not to partake.

## 25 May - Perception
A friend and fellow securities investor provided some unsolicited but constructive feedback on my blog. In his experience, blog quality is directly proportional to the perceived effort invested to maintain it. That is, the minimalist nature of my blog looked like a second-rate rag not worth reading.

After directing him to my home page which enumerates the consumer benefits of the layout, I dissected his statement more. The website was built from scratch as I was learning about cloud computing technologies. I wrote the whole thing using vim, the world's greatest text editor. I built a continuous integration pipeline to scan my code for syntax issues, check all my hyperlinks to ensure they were responding, ensure my images were compressed for faster downloads, hash every downloadable file for security, and more.

Every time I commit code, a continuous delivery process automatically deploys the updates into production **only if** all of the tests pass. I integrated email alerts into the pipeline for rapid feedback. I recently wrote my own Atom/RSS subscription code, which was a fun challenge. All this was done within the cloud using software-as-a-service, and I take pride in having built it myself. And, because I am **always** seeking to share knowledge and elevate the state of our industry, 100% of the underlying code is freely available.

My point is that the website took tremendous effort to initially build. Compare all this to the typical blogger who, with a few clicks of a mouse, subscribes to a faceless website building service. Presto, you've got a cookie-cutter blog. Nothing wrong with that, but I am writing about **perceived** effort. I've come to love the phrase "big hat, no cattle". Things and people are often not what they seem.

Perception in the military is all about looking smart/busy/cool/tough. No doubt perception plays a significant and largely negative role in our civilian lives, too. Seek to truly understand before deciding with your eyes. Paraphrasing Eric Ries, "which product is low quality, again?"

## 28 Sep - Knowledge
I've always been intrigued by nuanced differences between seemingly identical concepts. For example, design vs. architecture, training vs. education, and religion vs. spirituality to name a few. An event from my personal life is the focus of this blog, which targets seeking answers vs. seeking knowledge.

At my last job, I was on a technical team alongside traditional network engineers. Most were "expert beginners" or "meta engineers" to use a few labels coined by my friend and mentor, Russ White. These terms characterize engineers who memorize product specs and terminal commands but have little knowledge surrounding the underlying technologies. One of these engineers, a man I once held in good regard, was studying for an advanced college degree in Information Technology.

He asked me for help on a project and I was thrilled to oblige. He was using a task orchestration framework to automate the creation of virtual instances in a computing environment. His code wasn't working and I could tell he misunderstood the intended purpose of the tool. I gave him two answers via email.

My first answer was a quick-and-dirty solution which I suggested he try first so that he could see the final deployment result. It could be implemented in less than 2 minutes and would at least let him test the remainder of his code. Once complete, I suggested a bit of refactoring to follow the correct design principles best suited for his assignment rather than shell commands. This would have required about 30 minutes of total work.

The next day, he said he wasn't interested in using the tool as intended and was going to submit the sloppy solution. Had this been a high school project, I would have understood. When you are paying big money for a post-graduate degree, I imagine you'd want to maximize the knowledge you gain while enrolled. This particular engineer was only concerned with getting the answers quickly, submitting it, then promptly forgetting everything. Ironically, we deployed this tool in our production network but he never expressed interest in learning about it.

I was disappointed, but not upset. More importantly, I started thinking broadly about this problem of wanting answers rather than the mental toolbox needed to form your own answers. Senior engineers want to provide you thinking skills, not recital skills. Utilize us appropriately.

## 23 Aug - No Questions Asked
In late summer of 2013, I started a new position with a small Government contractor in northern Maryland. I spoke to one of the owners on the phone, who was both my new boss and the company's CTO. He was a matter-of-fact guy with the enthusiasm of Ben Stein. I wasn't sure what to expect.

We clashed in the beginning as I found him very demanding with no desire to praise, but plenty of capacity to criticize. It was not until about four months into the job that I learned to really respect him. We were at a job site where everything was out of control and, as contractors, we had little authority to change it. He took charge in an assertive but democratic way. I'll never forget what he said.

**"If I tell you to do something, you'll do it, no questions asked. If you tell me to do something, I'll do it, no questions asked."** The first sentence is a classic military statement and is well-suited in a top-down, command-and-control work environment. He was a military communications officer in a previous life, much like myself. The second sentence seemed like a platitude and I didn't take it seriously for one second. I would not have to wait long for the opportunity to test his commitment.

I was teaching a group of customers how to operate some communications equipment when I realized I was missing several Ethernet cables. I shouted for the boss and told him I needed six cables. He nodded and disappeared. Minutes later, I saw him sitting on the concrete like the rest of us. He was teaching others how to make the cables as he built them for me. He delivered them promptly and asked if I needed anything else. I couldn't believe it.

I try to use this style of leadership in my personal and professional life whenever I can. With mature colleagues, it does work. If your spouse can get on board with it, it's a life changer. We command one another, sometimes curtly, to do things. This isn't out of disrespect or control, because it goes both ways and the expectation is that whatever was requested will get fulfilled. There is no need for extraneous discourse.

I worked with that CTO on many other job sites and he stayed true to his word. He was hard-nosed because he was completely focused on results, and while a touch of empathy wouldn't kill him, I considered him a capable leader. 

## 9 Nov - Power Supply
I attended the Interop conference in 2019, which was both my first time attending and speaking at the event. After my talk, I spoke to many audience members, awkwardly carrying a laptop and power supply while trying to shake hands. I ended up losing my power supply and this frustrated me. I spent probably 10 minutes looking for it, but I suspect it was casually snagged by another attendee.

I wanted to be responsible and get it replaced quickly. I enlisted the help of a colleague who generously ordered me a replacement. It would be waiting on my doorstep for me **after** my trip. I still had two more days at Interop with plenty of work to do, both personal and work-related tasks. I'm an introvert who planned on blogging and studying that night. Instead, I realized that there were literally thousands of people I could meet if I was willing to vacate my comfort zone. It was not a hard choice. I promptly left my hotel room.

This was the best decision I could have made, and I am glad I did. That night, I linked up with some engineers I previously only knew virtually. Together, we enjoyed socializing and building personal relationships. The next day, I cleared my work calendar and signed up for many sessions. That evening, I attended a few mixers. One was Government-oriented, an industry in which I have extensive experience. The other was healthcare-oriented, an industry in which I have no experience. It was intriguing to participate in both discussions around how technology could advance the state of those different industries.

There was a big party later that evening, and I attended with my newly-made friends at these mixers. The conversation quickly shifted away from technology and into the personal space, which I very much enjoyed. The event was several hours long but seemed to end far too quickly. While walking back to the hotel, I became thoughtful and realized none of this would have transpired if my power supply hadn't been stolen. I smiled inwardly at the sticky-fingered engineer who secretly did me a huge favor.
